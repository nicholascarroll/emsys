## [Unreleased]
- `M-.` looks up Thai word at cursor delimited by U+200B ZERO WIDTH  SPACE
- `C-g` for pipe to shell improved to not clash with GPG password prompt

## [0.9.9]
- Added page up/down to prompt completion windows
- Palette no shows the Unicode name for the selected symbol
- Added `M-x insert-char` to insert a character by Unicode codepoint hex
- Improved `C-x =`: now shows Unicode codepoint
- Piped stdin is now a writeable special buffer. 
- Fixed a window's top line going blank after an edit deleted the row
  it was scrolled into.
- Fixed the same blank top line arising without a deletion.
- Fixed the terminal-ownership pty scenarios silently skipping instead
  of failing when the editor fails to enter raw mode. 
- Save now works like Vim's backupcopy=yes: inode is preserved. File is
  directly written with an ephemeral backup sidecar file suffixed '~'.
- Saving now direct-writes hard-linked files.
- Saving no longer replaces a FIFO, socket or device node.
- Fsync directory after backup created #122.
- A file whose directory is not writable can now be saved.
- Higlighting of matches in `query-replace` #106.
- On file save, a confirmation prompt if file on disk is newer
- Fixed the editor being left with the terminal in cooked mode after
  `C-z`, `C-x z` or `C-x C-z` when the raised `SIGTSTP` is discarded.
- Fixed a heap-buffer-overflow in `clampCursorToViewport`.
- Viewport arithmetic now just-in-time relative to the window. Drops
  the absolute screen-line coordinate (#111) and the buffer-level 
  screen-line cache behind it (#108); fixes C-l in word wrap mode.
- Fixed #112
- Added WASIX target. 

## [0.9.3]
- query-replace better error handling
- Fixed #103: After failing search, cursor position wrong
- Fixed heap corruption when undoing inside a prompt. 
- Fixed trailing blank lines being undeletable from the end of a buffer.
- A lone CR is no longer reported as a DOS line ending. A classic-Mac
  CR-only file keeps its CRs on save, so announcing a conversion to Unix
  endings promised something that does not happen.
- Opening a file that lacks a final newline, or that uses DOS line endings,
  now says so in the status line and states what will happen on save. The
  buffer stays clean, so an unedited file is never rewritten.
- Fixed piped input without a final newline leaving the last row non-empty,
  breaking the buffer invariant that every mutation path relies on.
- A file's trailing newline is now a buffer invariant.
- `C-x C-s` on a buffer with no unsaved changes now reports
  "(No changes need to be saved)" instead of rewriting the file.
- Fixed a heap-use-after-free in `scrollViewport`: `rowoff` was not
  clamped on entry, so scrolling up in word-wrap mode after an edit had
  deleted rows read a freed row. Pre-existing; found by `fuzz_undo.c`.
- Radical refactor of undo; implemented issues #104,#105. This fixes
  #102: undo of newlines at end of buffer fails
- A run of typing or deleting now becomes a new undo step every 20
- Fixed failure to undo insertions on the last line of the file #102.
- Fixed incremental search (`C-s`) starting from the top of the buffer #101
- Fixed a selection being drawn or hidden according to whether *another* window
  had a valid mark. 
- Fixed plain Shift-Tab doing nothing.
- Fixed Down in a prompt destroying typed text.
- Fixed `absolutePath` producing `//name` when the working directory is `/`.
- Fixed `C-x =` reporting a screen row computed from the wrong window.
- Fixed a multi-byte character being dropped on terminal resize.
- Fixed the status bar truncating a long filename mid-character.
- Fixed nested prompts corrupting the editor buffer. 
- Fixed a crash in `revert-buffer` on a buffer with no filename, reachable by
  starting `emil` with no arguments.
- `revert-buffer` now refuses when the file no longer exists.
- Fixed `zap-to-char` corrupting the buffer when given a non-character key.
- Fixed reverse incremental search (`C-r`) moving forward past point.
- Removed the between-rows interrupt poll from interactive search. 
- Rules for punctuation at right edge of screen in word wrap mode
- Cope with background/foregrounding and terminal resize while in the minibuffer
- Unrecognised command-line options now report to stderr and exit nonzero
- man page updates.
- The man page installs to `$(PREFIX)/share/man` rather than `$(PREFIX)/man`,
  and LICENSE installs to `$(PREFIX)/share/licenses/emil`. Upgrading from
  0.8.0 leaves an orphaned `/usr/local/man/man1/emil.1` that `make uninstall`
  will not remove; delete it by hand.
- `make hal` builds with an expanded warning set as errors, and runs the
  test suite under `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3` so the fortified build is actually
  executed rather than only compiled.
- In atomic write, preserve owner. #98.
- Clamp universal argument at 1 million #99.
- Allow entry of newline with `C-q C-j` in `replace-regexp` #96.
- Fixed bug in rectangle edit that caused UTF-8 corruption.

### Correction to 0.7.0
- #90 (read-only buffer corruption from kill-rectangle) was listed under Known
  Bugs in 0.7.0 and fixed during 0.8.0 by the `rejectIfReadOnly` guard at the
  rectangle command entry points, but was never recorded as closed. It is
  fixed.
